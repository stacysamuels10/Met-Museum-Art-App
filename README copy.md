# Overview

This project features the Met Museum's API and is aimed at children on a field trip to the Met. It is a web application optimized for mobile. It displays a random artwork/artifact that is on display at the museum and gives the user 2 hints. A third hint of what department the artwork is in will be displayed when the button is pressed and a solution of the name will be displayed if the solution button is pressed. This site was programmed in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
